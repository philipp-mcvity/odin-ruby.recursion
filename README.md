##### PROJECT: BUILDING BLOCKS

###### Warmup: Fibonacci
  1. Write a method `#fibs` which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence.  Use iteration for this solution.
  2. Now write another method `#fibs_rec` which solves the same problem recursively.  This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you're crazy, but don't consider either of these lengths a requirement... just get it done).


###### Project: Merge Sort
  Build a method `#merge_sort` that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
